    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts , cut in half horizontally to make 6 breast halves</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian style bread crumbs, or panko</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons oil (vegetable or olive oil)</li>
        <li>24 ounces marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil leaves, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish or similar size oven-safe dish.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: Place each chicken breast half between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound the chicken to an even thickness of about ½ inch. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prepare the breading station: In a shallow bowl, combine ¼ cup of the parmesan cheese, eggs, and a pinch of salt and pepper. In another shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic powder, and remaining ¼ cup parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bread the chicken: Dip each chicken breast half into the egg mixture, allowing any excess to drip off, then dredge in the bread crumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Place the breaded chicken on a plate or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the breaded chicken breasts (in batches if necessary) and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked chicken to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Add sauce and cheese: Spoon marinara sauce over each piece of chicken, then sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Garnish and serve: Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving. Enjoy your delicious Chicken Parmesan!</li>
