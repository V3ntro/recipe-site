    <center><p>Empanadas are a popular type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry dough folded over a sweet or savory filling. The name comes from the Spanish verb empanar, which translates as "to wrap or coat in bread". 
Empanadas are found throughout Spain, Portugal, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Philippines, with each region featuring unique variations in dough (wheat or corn flour, plantain, or yuca-based), filling, and cooking method.</p></center>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella)</li>
        <li>1 package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes until well combined. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Roll out the refrigerated pie crusts on a lightly floured surface. Use a round cutter (about 4-6 inches in diameter) to cut out circles from the dough.</li>
        <li>Spoon a small amount of the beef mixture onto one half of each dough circle. Sprinkle some shredded cheese on top of the beef.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over to create a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
        <li>Place the empanadas on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with the beaten egg to give them a golden color when baked.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the empanadas are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your delicious beef empanadas!</li> 
    </ol>
